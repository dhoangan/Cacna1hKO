1) File "Cacna1h_KO_WT_patchclamp_fit_biexponential.ipynb":
  - Fit elicited currents with biexponential function to obtain peak current amplitudes.
  - If data can not be fitted, then calculate the mean of the data
  - Results and fit parameters are recorded in data_IV_40_WT, data_IV_40_KO, data_IV_WT, data_IV_KO


2) File "Cacna1h_KO_WT_patchclamp_analysis.ipynb":
  - Use data in files data_IV_40_WT, data_IV_40_KO, data_IV_WT, data_IV_KO to generate IV curves of peak currents.
  - Fit IV curves with equation (1)

3) File "max_amplitude_LMM.R"
  - Compare T-type and L-type peak current amplitudes for KO vs WT at -15 mV and -35 mV (likelihood ratio test of linear mixed models).
